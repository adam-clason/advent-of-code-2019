# Advent of Code Rust Programs

Subfolders of this repository contain rust crates that can be used to obtain solutions for the puzzles in [advent of code 2019](https://adventofcode.com)

To run these programs you will need your puzzle input for each day. The rust programs provide the solutions to the second puzzle for each day. The second puzzle generally seems to contain the first in its solution.

    `cargo run <input_file_name>`

2. Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm

    `cargo run <input_file_name> <output_needed>`

    The second parameter is the output given by the puzzle. The program calculates 2 inputs that will result in the given output.
